Title: About

Hi everyone, welcome to my personal site. Abandoning Wordpress, I decided to adopt Pelican just to keep making effort in my python endeavor. My name is Yu Cheng, I'm a second year PhD student/Research assistant in the department of physical oceanography, Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science, University of Miami, working under the supervision of Dr. Lisa Beal and Dr. Ben Kirtman.

I am from Taiwan, received my B.S. degreee in Atmospheric Science from National Taiwan University in 2010, fulfilled my military duty from 2010-2011. Before coming to Miami, I spent an year working at Labrotory for Climate Change Research, Academica Sinica.

My research interets include large scale ocean circulation and its coupling effect with climate system, specifically the interaction between Agulhas leakage and the Atlantic Meridional Oerturning circulation. Now, I am focusing on quantify the Agulhas Leakage in the High-Resolution coupled climate model output using Lagrangiain virtual particle approach. 

Beside research, I spent most of my time playing tennis and badminton, stringing racquets, and working out. In fact, the SONY OPEN every March is one of the reasons that urged me to make the decision to come here. Throughout the year, Miami offers the best weather and courts for tennis, if you happen to be in the region and want to hit fuzzy green balls around, but lacking partners, just email me!
