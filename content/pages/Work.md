Title: Work

Reaserch is a restless endeavor, most of time I am feel like I am lost, but looking backwards, I realized how much I've done and learned, mostly by accidents. 

###Course Works

---------------------------
####Fall 2012:####
 * MPO 503 Physical Oceanography 
 * MPO 511 Geophysical Fluid Dynamics I 
 * MPO 551 Intro to Atmospheric Science
 
*Projects:*

* Autonomous Underwater Vehicles: REMUS-100 and its application in coastal current study (MPO 503)
* and Circumglobal teleconnection and jet-stream waveguide (MPO 511).

*Misc.:*

Typing most of homeworks and full class notes of Physical Oceanography, I've got my basic knowledge of LaTeX, it was also my first attempt to learn python. 

---------------------------

####Spring 2013:####
* MPO 611 Geophysical Fluid Dynamics II 
* MPO 612 Large-scale Ocean Circulation 
* MPO 665 General Circulation of Atmosphere 
* MPO 583 Special Topics in Climate study 
 
*Projects:* 

* Seasonality and trends in Agulhas Retroflection (MPO612)
* Western boundary current separation: potential vorticity crisis (MPO611). 

*Misc.:*

Got the basic idea about Python and began to apply it to my work, using packages such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib. Accompished my comprehensive exam in May 2013.

---------------------------
####Summer 2013:####
Hands on the Connectivity Modeling System for Lagrangian transport experiment with high-res CCSM output, participated in the CESM tutorial 2013 in NCAR. Using Python/NCL, I built a system to automatically download and plot GHRSST/RTOFS satellites and real time forecasting ocean surface data. Later compressed and transfered to a Dropbox shared folder for the daily cruise-route planning of coming METEOR 100/2 cruise.

---------------------------
####Fall 2013,####
* MPO 668 ENSO Dynamic

*Misc.:*

Joined the METEOR 100/2 cruise, visited the Agulhas for the first time, also my first experience of in-situ physical oceanography measurements, using instruments such as CTD, LADCP, U-CTD, and learned the post-processing scripts and procedures.

---------------------------
####Spring 2014:####
* MPO 524 Applied Data Analysis

*Project:*

 * [Spectrum Analysis of Agulhas Current & Agulhas Leakage Timeseries (using matplotlib/ipython)](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/ycheng/pdfs/mpo524_project_yucheng)

 *Misc.:*

 For the first time in my graduate school, I gave my 20 min seminar talks. You are welcome to read the abstract. [Agulhas leakage in Eddy resolving CCSM: a Lagrangian approach.](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/ycheng/pdfs/abstract_ycheng.pdf); [Presentation slides](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/ycheng/pdfs/Seminar_Feb12_YuCheng.pdf)
 
---------------------------
####Fall 2014:####
* MPO 675 Mesoscale Oceanography

*Project:*

 * [Degradation of Agulhas Leakage estimates corresponding to temporal resolution](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/ycheng/pdfs/MPO675_yucheng_final_written.pdf);[Presentation slides](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/ycheng/pdfs/MPO675_final.pdf)

---------------------------
###TA works
* ATM/MSC 118 Current topics of Weather & Climate: grading term papers, quizzes, and gave a 50 min lecture about ["Ocean & Climate change"](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/ycheng/pdfs/Mar_19_Oceans_and_Climate_Change).

* MSC 220 [Climate & Global Change](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/pzuidema/Flyer_220.pdf): Beside grading quizzes and mid-terms, I gave two talks. The first one covered "Water, aerosols and ozone", slides provided by the professor. I prepared the second talk from scratch, titled ["climate change mitigation."](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/ycheng/pdfs/20141204_MSC220_Mitigation)
