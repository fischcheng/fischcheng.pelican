Title: Work

Reaserch is a restless endeavor, most of time I am feel like I am lost, but looking backwards, I realized how much I've done and learned, mostly by accidents. 

###Course Works

---------------------------
####Fall 2012:####
 * MPO 503 Physical Oceanography 
 * MPO 511 Geophysical Fluid Dynamics I 
 * MPO 551 Intro to Atmospheric Science
 
######Projects:######
* Autonomous Underwater Vehicles: REMUS-100 and its application in coastal current study (MPO 503)
* and Circumglobal teleconnection and jet-stream waveguide (MPO 511).

Typing most of homeworks and full class notes of Physical Oceanography, I've got my basic knowledge of LaTeX, it was also my first attempt to learn python. 

---------------------------

####Spring 2013:####
* MPO 611 Geophysical Fluid Dynamics II 
* MPO 612 Large-scale Ocean Circulation 
* MPO 665 General Circulation of Atmosphere 
* MPO 583 Special Topics in Climate study 
 
######Projects:######
* Seasonality and trends in Agulhas Retroflection (MPO612)
* Western boundary current separation: potential vorticity crisis (MPO611). 

Got the basic ideas about Python and began to apply them to my work, using packages such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib. Accompished my comprehensive exam in May 2013.

---------------------------
####Summer 2013:####
Hands on the Connectivity Modeling System for Lagrangian transport experiment with high-res CCSM output, participated in the CESM tutorial 2013 in NCAR. Using Python/NCL, I built a system to automatically download and plot GHRSST/RTOFS satellites and real time forecasting ocean surface data. Later compressed and transfered to a Dropbox shared folder for the daily cruise-route planning of coming METEOR 100/2 cruise.

---------------------------
####Fall 2013,####
* MPO 668 ENSO Dynamic

Joined the METEOR 100/2 cruise, visited the Agulhas for the first time, also my first experience of in-situ physical oceanography measurements, using instruments such as CTD, LADCP, U-CTD, and learned the post-processing scripts and procedures.

---------------------------
####Spring 2014:####
* MPO 524 Applied Data Analysis

---------------------------
###TA works
* ATM/MSC 118 Current topics of Weather & Climate: grading term papers, quizzes, and gave a 50 min lecture about ["Ocean & Climate change"](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/ycheng/pdfs/Mar_19_Oceans_and_Climate_Change).

* MSC 220 [Climate & Global Change](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/pzuidema/Flyer_220.pdf): Beside grading quizzes and mid-terms, I gave two talks. The first one covered "Water, aerosols and ozone", slides provided by the professor. I prepared the second talk from scratch, titled ["climate change mitigation."](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/ycheng/pdfs/20141204_MSC220_Mitigation)
