I've been struggling to put my personal blog together using Pelican/Github Page.

Now I am stuck by the restructedText syntax, I've had some experience on Markdown, but none of .rst.

I couldn't even get the Sublime package for rst snippets to work, not to mention changing font or line distance.

Now gonna spend sometime on the new coming laguage, Julia, which I have a high expectation on!
