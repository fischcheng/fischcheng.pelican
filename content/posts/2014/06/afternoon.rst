I've been working on building this site for about three days now, ever since I found out the existence of Github page and Pelican. Even though I attempted to try the Jekyll at first, because of my love of Python, I ended up using Pelican.

**reStructuredText**

So now the greatest challenge I am facing is the reStructuredText. I still couldn't fully get the idea of rst, with my preference of Markdown. The layout of my blog is pretty much set, thanks to the Bootstrap 3 theme. Maybe someday I'll come back to figure out how to change the default fonts or tweak the stylesheet a little bit more. Now, better for me to focus on my own research.
