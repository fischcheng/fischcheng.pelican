Scussolini, E. van Sebille, J.V. Durgadoo: Paleo Agulhas rings enter the subtropical gyre during the penultimate deglaciation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What scientific questions are the authors addressing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum strength of Agulhas leakage is identified during the glacial Termination II. The authors attempt to demonstrate the leakage, mostly in the form of rings, was effectively incorporated into the South Atlantic gyre, instead of retroflecting back to Southern or Indian ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What methods do the authors use to address the questions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They investigate the presence of paleo Agulhas rings from a sediment core on the central Walvis Ridge (64PE-174P13, 29.45.71'S, 2.24.10'E, 2914m deep). By selecting the appropriate species of plaktic foraminifer, they aim to target the salinity and temperature anomalies induced by the leakage at the depth of the thermocline. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyzing INALT01 60yr model output to relate density perturbations at thermocline depth to the passage of individual rings over the core site. They concluded that the increasing variability of density at thermocline depth can be contributed to increasing passage of Agulhas rings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using this relation as a basis of proxy of Agulhas leakage, they generate a time series of individual Globorotalia truncatulinoides O_18 variability to infer the variability of Agulhas leakage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the authors' main conclusions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong relation between SSH and potential density at 452m variability is prominent in INALT01. Fig3 shows the temporal variability induced by individual Agulhas ring crossings the chosen core location. The largest density troughs can be attributed to passing Agulhas rings. Out of average 6 rings/year, the core site captures on average one to two full rings according to a Fourier analysis of SSH on the location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time series shows high levels of pycnocline depth variability at the site, suggesting enhanced numbers of Agulhas rings moving into the South Atlantic Gyre around glacial Termination II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their results closely follow the previous quantifications of Agulhas leakage from the east of the Cape Basin (other sediments cores.), showing that Indian Ocean waters enter the South Atlantic circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the implications of the results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By targeting the isotopes in appropriate species, scientists can not only study certain era of sediments cores, but also specific levels of the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result is a crucial support for the view of a prominent role of the Agulhas leakage in the shift from a glacial to an interglacial mode of the Atlantic circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the increased leakage during the glacial termination did make it into subtropical gyre, the corresponding salt and heat were not neccesarily advected across the equator. However, modeling evidence show that the heat and salt from the Leakage do not have to reach the North Atlantic to impact the AMOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose this paper?&lt;/strong&gt;
Back to work on leakage, digging something more that supporting the claim that Agulhas leakage has impact on Atlantic circulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a summer using Microsoft Frontpage to build a website, hosted by my highschool's server. Then I also had my first experience with PHP, javascript, html, css, cgi (common gateway interface, I haven't seen such things for a while!) However, some popular free-webpage services just kept popping out the years after, as "blog" became a everyday word. All of a sudden, a vibrant and powerful "blog", usually implemented with guestbook and albums is just few clicks away. Thus, I stop writing my own webpages. That was ten years ago. Years later, even MS Frontpage is discontinued. End of last summer, every students in RSMAS got an mail about annual progress report, and building your personal page is listed as a requirment. I first cheated by adding a new blog using wordpress, refusing to revisit my old friends, being afraid of spending too much time on such distractions. However, these distractions just won't dispear even though I tried hard to ignore... Therefore, after the tiring semster with TA and seminar talk, I came back to revisit some other interesting stuffs I've had no time to spend on for the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pelican: I love this bird!!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard about Django quite often, so it was my first try. Lacking of PHP knowledge, and a personal site needs not to have some log-in or user-management functions, I decided to build a static blog. By accident, I noticed that lots of technical blogs are hosted by Github, and powered by Jekyll, Octopress or Pelican. The reason that I chose Pelican, is simply because it's python/jinja2 based. And I happened to find some very good references:       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/"&gt;http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.xlarrakoetxea.org/posts/2012/10/creating-a-blog-with-pelican/"&gt;http://blog.xlarrakoetxea.org/posts/2012/10/creating-a-blog-with-pelican/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican"&gt;https://github.com/getpelican&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img width="400" src="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/PHOTO/LARGE/brown_pelican_5.jpg" height="500"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is a static site engine powered by python, using templates based on Jinja2. It supports both reStructuredText and Markdown, as well as asciiDoc and html, which makes writing new posts extremely easy. The center of a pelican-powered site is the &lt;em&gt;configuration.py&lt;/em&gt; file, which controls the basic settings of your site, including side bar, navigation bar options, disqus-comments, tags, categories, twitter supports, and PATH. All the original files (including .md, .rst files) are stored in /contents, and all the html generated by Pelican go to /output folder. Simply upload the /output folder to your web-host, and T'ADA, your website is on. For details of installation and deployment, pleace check official Pelican documentation.       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/"&gt;http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Themes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that I chose Pelican is the active community on Github. As mentioned above, pelican templates are generated by Jinja2, which is a template engine powered by Python. A set of themes including templates of different pages and stylesheets. There are many high-quality themes available on github, which can be easily downloaded using following command:        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This blog is powered by pelican-bootstraps3 theme; few other themes I would also like to try are Pelican-pure, Mockingbird and Notmyidea. Additional stylesheet can be easily integrated by changing the setting in &lt;em&gt;configuration.py&lt;/em&gt;. To switch between different themes, just modify this line in your &lt;em&gt;configuration.py&lt;/em&gt;.         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;THEME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;pelican-bootstrap3&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# or whatever themes you like&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Customize&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a more tricky part, due to my limited knowledge of CSS and Jinja2. So far I've only managed to change the background color, font size, line-height and link-hover style of my header. Even though the syntax of CSS is very straightforward, lacking of nested structure, it is very difficult to read the CCS stylesheet by someone else: one must figure out the class/ID names of each elements in the html files, and locate corresponding tags in the minified CSS file. I've found a Sublime-Text package to unminify the CSS, yet still find it difficult to change even a single property. Currently, I am attempting to use SASS/COMPASS to rewrite the stylesheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Plugins&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of greatest feature of Pelican is to include modular plugins into your static site. Same as Pelican-themes, these plugins can be downloaded easily from github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins.git
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Curretnly, I am using the Liquid-tags plugin by &lt;a href="mailto:jakevdp@cs.washington.edu"&gt;Jake Vanderplas&lt;/a&gt; to enable Youtube video, iPython notebook, code-block and image insertion in my blog posts, as well as the Math-rendering. Other plugins such as Gravatar and internal-links are very easily to be implemented, in fact, just two lines in the &lt;em&gt;configuration.py&lt;/em&gt;. The idea of plugins, are similar to the idea of importing libraries in the beginning of every Python scripts.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Plugins&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;PLUGIN_PATH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/Users/yucheng/Desktop/Other/MyPage/pelican-plugin&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;PLUGINS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;liquid_tags.img&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;liquid_tags.video&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;liquid_tags.youtube&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;liquid_tags.vimeo&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;liquid_tags.include_code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;liquid_tags.notebook&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;render_math&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is a really powerful static-site generator, using Python. All options you may play with are in the &lt;em&gt;configuration.py&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;syltesheet.css&lt;/em&gt;. The official documentation of Pelican is rather complete, not to mention the active developer-base. If you are a Python lover, it won't take you too long to setup a really polished and somehow-dynamic static site. So, look no further, among numerous static-site engines, Pelican is definitely one of the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Yu Cheng</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2014 12:05:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fischcheng.github.io,2014-06-10:building-a-statistic-blog-with-pelican.html</guid><category>pelican</category><category>python</category><category>markdown</category><category>bootstrap</category></item><item><title>Agulhas Group meeting notes</title><link>https://fischcheng.github.io/agulhas-group-meeting-notes.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL059473/abstract"&gt;C. D. Roberts, L. Jackson andD. McNeall, 2014: Is the 2004–2012 reduction of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation significant?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What scientific questions are the authors addressing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the observed (by MOCHA array) 8 year trend (2004-2012, -0.53Sv/yr) of AMOC is significant, in comparison to the 14 CMIP5 models preindustrial control runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What methods do the authors use to address the questions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existed oberserved timeseries is not long enough, and there is yet no consensus on the magnitude, periodicities, and mechanisms of AMOC variability across different models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick out the models with overturning streamfunction diagnostics on the CMIP5 archive (14), indices defined as the maximum streamfunction at the model latitude closest to 26.5N, annual mean taken from Apr-Mar adopted by the RAPID array (why?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplely compare distribution of 8yr trends of different models to the observed trend. However, every models seem underestimate the interannual variability of AMOC (Fig2, b,c)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combining the temporal correlation characteristics of AMOC from CMIP5 models with an observational estimate of interannual variability to account for this bias. (using autoregressive moving average model to fit CMIP5 AMOC timeseries, and add the upper limit of observed variability.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the authors' main conclusions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eight year trends ≤ −0.53 Sv/yr are relatively common in GFDL-CM3 and GFDL-ESM2M, but they are extremely unusual (or out of range) in the other 12 models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying modification of observed variability on top of temporal correlation of Model AMOC timeseries, the observed AMOC trend is not significantly different (p &amp;gt; 0.01) from that expected due to internal AMOC variability. (Fig 2, 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the AMOC continues to decrease at a rate of −0.53 Sv/yr, it will take a total of 18 yearsbefore the trend is significantly different from all 14 ARMA-based estimates of internal AMOC variability (red line in Figure 3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the implications of the results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors find that 14 different CMIP5 models underestimate the magnitude of AMOC variability on interannual time scales, which may due to insufficient atmospheric variability on interannual time scales, and the coarse resolution of ocean in CMIP5 simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not yet possible to distinguish between mechanisms or dominant time scales due to the short length of the existing observational AMOC record. Discriminating between different models and refining estimates of internal AMOC variability require more than one decade of continuous AMOC observations. All this is calling for the consruction of a more powerful observation system, including monitoring water mass properties in the subpolar gyre and similar arrays at additional lattitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose this paper?&lt;/strong&gt;
I am digging out materials about AMOC in climate models. &lt;/p&gt;
